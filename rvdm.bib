     abstract = {A general device is proposed, which provides for extension of exponential inequalities for sums of independent real-valued random variables to those for martingales in the 2-smooth Banach spaces. This is used to obtain optimum bounds of the Rosenthal-Burkholder and Chung types on moments of the martingales in 2-smooth Banach spaces. In turn, it leads to best-order bounds on moments of sums of independent random vectors in any separable Banach spaces. Although the emphasis is put on infinite-dimensional martingales, most of the results seem to be new even for one-dimensional martingales. Moreover, the bounds on moments of the Rosenthal-Burkholder type seem to be to a certain extent new even for sums of independent real-valued random variables. Analogous inequalities for (one-dimensional) supermartingales are given.},

    Abstract = {We investigate the use of sparse coding and dictionary learning in the context of multitask and transfer learning. The central assumption of our learning method is that the tasks parameters are well approximated by sparse linear combinations of the atoms of a dictionary on a high or infinite dimensional space. This assumption, together with the large quantity of available data in the multitask and transfer learning settings, allows a principled choice of the dictionary. We provide bounds on the generalization error of this approach, for both settings. Numerical experiments on one synthetic and two real datasets show the advantage of our method over single task learning, a previous method based on orthogonal and dense representation of the tasks and a related method learning task grouping.}
